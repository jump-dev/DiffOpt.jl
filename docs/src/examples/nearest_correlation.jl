# Example from [H02, p. 334-335]:

A = LinearAlgebra.Tridiagonal(ones(2), ones(3), ones(2))

# The projection is computed as follows:

X, dX = proj(A)
nothing # hide

# The projection of `A` is:

X

# The derivative of the projection with respect to a uniform increase of the weights
# of the diagonal entries is:

dX

# Example from [H02, Section 4, p. 340]:

A = LinearAlgebra.Tridiagonal(-ones(3), 2ones(4), -ones(3))

# The projection is computed as follows:

X, dX = proj(A)
nothing # hide

# The projection of `A` is:

X

# The derivative of the projection with respect to a uniform increase of the weights
# of the diagonal entries is:

dX
